    "  - week_dates.csv: A spreadsheet with 4 columns giving the year, week number, week start date, week end date\n",
    "  - deaths.csv: A spreadsheet with minimum 3 columns: Year, Week, Deaths. If available, you can also include subgroups by age, sex, region, condition.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Ideally, the whole process is automated in a notebook, from downloading the files, reformatting them, and saving the above two .csv files. Sometimes however, it's easier to download manually. In that case, clearly outline the steps in the notebook on how to update the data in the future, and include and subsequent processing step."
